# Task for Front End Developer (TypeScript)
## First steps
1. Fork this repo
2. Create a single-page application for a blogging website with Angular 2+ (or other JavaScript framework)
4. Use TypeScript if your framework of choice supports it
5. Prepare a pull request and let us know that you are done
## General guidelines
* Use common sense and don't spend too much time on a single task if you get stuck
* This task might not specify every single detail of how it should be implemented. When in doubt, improvise and go with a solution that you think would work best for a project like this
## Requirements
* Use the latest version of Angular
* Use the API to retrieve data (details below)
* Make sure the app is responsive and looks clean
* Use components where applicable


<strong>Keep in mind that candidates who used TS  and/ or Angular 2+ will have an upper hand during the initial filtering.</strong>
## Functional requirements
The website should have the following pages (components):
**Homepage**
Should contain a list of all blog posts.
**Post page**
Should contain post title, full-content, post author details, a link to the post's edit page.
**Post creation page**
Should contain a form for creating a new post. It should have 2 inputs: title and post body. Once the form is submitted it should make a `POST` request to a corresponding API endpoint with all inputs in the request body.
**Post edit page**
The form should be the same as with post creation. The only difference is that inputs should be pre-filled and that the app should run a `PUT` request to another endpoint.
## API guidelines
Use this API service that provides random data for a blog project like this:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
For example, to retrieve a list of all available posts you would run a `GET` request to the following URL:
```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```
Similarly, you would run a `PUT` request to the following URL to update a post with an ID of `3`:
```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
```
Please note that when updating or creating new entries, the API might not save the changes. That is fine as long as you make the necessary `POST` / `PUT` requests.
### Few tips
- We always prefer the code that is robust, easy to read and re-usable
- Make design user friendly
- Have fun!
